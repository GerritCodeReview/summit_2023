# Lightweight Forks

Git supports the concept of alternate object databases. Compared to other
products, Gerrit currently does not offer users to fork a repository.

The use cases for forks could be manifold: From personal workspaces to
eventually supporting pull requests. More generally: A place where one
can use all of the upstream data, yet, doesn't pollute the upstream repo
with unfinished work.

In this lightning talk I'll go over some CUJs and talk about technical
background.
