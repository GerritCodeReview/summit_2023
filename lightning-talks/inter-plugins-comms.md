# Inter-plugins communication

Luca has proposed and introduced the concept of plugins in Gerrit
Code Review during the
[GitTogether 2011 unconference](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2011/12/gittogether-2011.html)
when it was still hosted at [GooglePlex in Mountain View CA](https://goo.gl/maps/XsUr7cULWhBi9dwC8).

After 12 years of successful adoption and the development of
a [huge variety of plugins](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/plugins.html)
the architecture needs a bit of modernisation.

Luca will present the history behind the proposal of cross-plugins
communication, with the proposals on the table by different
maintainers, including people from Qualcomm and GerritForge.
