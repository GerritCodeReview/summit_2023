# GHS (Git Health Service)

In this talk, I will got through some of the issues you might encounter when
trying to keep your Git repository in shape.

I will go through the open source tooling available, and introduce a new tool
GerritForge have been working on recently to approach the Git repo maintenance
problem in a more systematic way on large-scale systems.

The tool is agnostic of the Git server you are running and
is flexible enough to smoothly integrate into your ecosystem.
