# Code Review Research Highlights

In this talk, I will two recent studies that my
[Software REBELs](https://rebels.cs.uwaterloo.ca/) research
group has conducted of the topic of code review. In the
[first study](https://rebels.cs.uwaterloo.ca/confpaper/2023/05/13/code-review-of-build-system-specifications-prevalence-purposes-patterns-and-perceptions.html),
we analyzed code review practices when build files are
the subject of the modification. In the
[second study](https://rebels.cs.uwaterloo.ca/confpaper/2022/09/25/exploring-the-notion-of-risk-in-code-reviewer-recommendation.html),
we use ML-based risk estimates to complement other high-level
goals when recommending code reviewers for incoming tasks in a
history-based simulation.
