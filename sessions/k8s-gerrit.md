# Status update of the "Gerrit on Kubernetes" project

The "Gerrit on Kubernetes" (short: k8s-gerrit) project aims to provide a simple
way of deploying Gerrit into a Kubernetes cluster using the operator pattern.
The resulting Gerrit Operator allows to install a Gerrit cluster consisting of
multiple primary Gerrits and Gerrit Replicas to serve workloads at scale and
providing high availability. The Gerrit Operator manages boilerplate configuration
and thus makes it easier to get Gerrit running in Kubernetes.

Thomas will present a short overview over the current status and the upcoming
plans.

This talk will be presented online.
