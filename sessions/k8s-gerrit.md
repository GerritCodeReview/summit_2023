# Status update of the "Gerrit on Kubernetes" project

The "Gerrit on Kubernetes" (short: k8s-gerrit) project aims to provide a simple
way of deploying Gerrit into a Kubernetes cluster using the operator pattern.
The resulting Gerrit Operator allows to install a Gerrit cluster consisting of
multiple primary Gerrits and replica Gerrits to serve workloads at scale and
provide high availability. The Gerrit Operator manages boilerplate configuration
and simplifying Gerrit deployment on Kubernetes.

Thomas will present a short overview over the current status and the upcoming
plans.

This talk will be presented online.
