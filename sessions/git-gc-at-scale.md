# Git GC at scale for Pro

In this talk, I will explain some challenges
you might encounter when trying to keep your Git repository
in shape.

I will introduce a new tool I have been working on recently
to approach the Git GC problem in a more systematic way
on large-scale systems.

The tool is agnostic of the Git server you are running and
is flexible enough to smoothly integrate into your ecosystem.
