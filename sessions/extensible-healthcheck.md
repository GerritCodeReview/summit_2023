# Tailor Gerrit's healthcheck with Extensible Checks

In this short lighting talk we will showcase a new healthcheck plugin feature
we have been working on.  We introduced a novel method for assessing the health
status of Gerrit instances, extending beyond standard checks such as auth,
Lucene queries, and Git repository status. We'll detail how to allow other
Gerrit plugins to seamlessly integrate their own health assessment components
and we'll demonstrate the practical benefits of customizing health evaluation.
