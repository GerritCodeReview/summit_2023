## How to reach GerritForge from the San Jose Airport

__By Taxi__

[Uber](http://www.uber.com) and [Lyft](http://www.lyft.com) are the most popular ways of moving
around in the Silicon Valley. Use them if you are concerned about not finding parking space in Sunnyvale.

__By Car__

The travelling time from the San Jose Airport to downtown Sunnyvale is typically around 20 mins. However,
traffic conditions change rapidily in the Silicon Valley and the best route changes consequently.

Under normal conditions (very early morning, late evening and week-ends), the best route is:
- Get on CA-87 N from Airport Blvd
- Take US-101 N to N Mathilda Ave in Sunnyvale. Take the exit for Mathilda Avenue S from US-101 N
- Continue on N Mathilda Ave. Drive to S Murphy Ave

## Parking

There are several options for parking in the area. See the map below.

Please note that on Saturday morning, a farmerâ€™s market runs in Murphy Avenue, therefore this street is closed
for cars and the area can get busy with pedestrians.
